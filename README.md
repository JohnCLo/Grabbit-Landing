The landing page is fully responsive and if it detects an iOS device will reveal a download button that allows the user to bookmark the url to their homescreen. When the user clicks the icon on the homescreen, the application will detect that it is an iOS device and in fullscreen modde and render the web application powered by Ionic and AngularJS.<br/><br/>

More than anything this is a demonstration of the increasing versatility of web application and apps that do not require an "app store".<br/><br/>
